# Feature selection for classifying level of mental workload.
This data came from a brain-computer interface experiment using an Emotiv EPOC electroencephalography headset and virtual reality for aircraft flight simulation. Flight difficulty 
varied, and I am interested in evaluating if variations in workload corresponds to reliable changes in electroencephalography signals and if there is potential to use these signals to predict pilot workload level. 

I experimented with some data looking at features of electroencephalography across participants. The purpose of this investigation is to inform which features
to select for classification model. A report can be seen here: https://akfraser96.github.io/R_EEG_Power_Densities/index.html
